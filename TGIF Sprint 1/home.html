                Lorem
                Ipsum
                has been the industry's
                standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                scrambled it to
                make
                a
                type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                typesetting,
                remaining essentially unchanged.<span class="read-more-target"> It was popularised in the 1960s with
                    the
                    release of Letraset sheets containing
                    Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
                    including

                    of
                    Lorem Ipsum.



                    <p>Where does it come from?
                        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece
                        of
                        classical
                        Latin
                        literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor
                        at
                        Hampden-Sydney
                        College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
                        Lorem Ipsum
                        passage, and
                        going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable
                        source.
                        Lorem
                        Ipsum
                        comes
                        from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good
                        and Evil)
                        by
                        Cicero,
                        written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
                        Renaissance.
                        The
                        first
                        line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

                        The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those
                        interested.
                        Sections
                        1.10.32
                        and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their
                        exact
                        original
                        form,
                        accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>


                    </p>
                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been
                    the
                    industry's
                    standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                    scrambled it
                    to
                    make
                    a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                    typesetting,
                    remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
                    sheets
                    containing
                    Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
                    including
                    versions
                    of Lorem Ipsum.
                    Why do we use it? It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable
                    content
                    of
                    a
                    page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less
                    normal
                    distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like
                    readable
                    English.
                    Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model
                    text,
                    and a
                    search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions
                    have
                    evolved
                    over
                    the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
                    Where does it come from? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It
                    has roots
                    in
                    a
                    piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard
                    McClintock, a
                    Latin
                    professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
                    consectetur,
                    from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature,
                    discovered
                    the
                    undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum
                    et
                    Malorum"
                    (The
                    Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of
                    ethics,
                    very
                    popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",
                    comes
                    from a
                    line
                    in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below
                    for those
                    interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also
                    reproduced
                    in
                    their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.
                    Rackham.</p>
